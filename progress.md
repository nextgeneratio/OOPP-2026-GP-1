## Structure Execution Update — 2026-09-30
- Executed `00-project-structure-prompt.md` only.
- Created the Maven project descriptor with Java 17 release settings and required dependency declarations.
- Created the Maven source/resource/test layout and the `lk.ac.ruhuna.fot.ams` package structure.
- Added architecture, database-design, and testing-strategy documentation placeholders.
- Added configuration examples, logging configuration, database/script placeholders, and test resource placeholders.
- Added ignore rules for build output, local credentials, logs, and user uploads.
- No Phase 1 implementation was started.
- Validation: Maven validation was attempted but could not run because `mvn` is not installed in the environment.
- Next task: await instruction to begin `01-instruction-foundation.md`.

## Phase 1 Foundation Update — 2026-09-30
- Read `progress.md` before starting Phase 1 execution.
- Implemented configuration loading with environment-variable support and ignored local credentials.
- Implemented JDBC connection and transaction abstractions using prepared-statement-compatible connection access.
- Imported the supplied MySQL schema into `src/main/resources/db/schema.sql` and deferred the attendance-session timetable foreign key until its parent table exists.
- Added development seed data for 1 Admin, 5 Lecturers, 4 Technical Officers, 20 Undergraduates, master data, offerings, enrolments, repeat/batch-missed attempts, and grade rows.
- Seed accounts use salted PBKDF2 hashes; no plaintext password was added to project files.
- Implemented the `User` inheritance hierarchy, role/status enums, repository/authentication/eligibility interfaces, and validated core domain objects for users, marks, assessments, courses, and medical records.
- Implemented application exceptions, safe GUI error translation, password hashing/verification, authenticated sessions, and service-layer authorization guards.
- Implemented a JDBC `UserDao`, authentication controller, Swing theme, reusable button, main frame, login frame, and EDT application bootstrap.
- Added foundation unit tests for domain validation, password hashing, and authorization, plus a MySQL connectivity integration test.
- Validation: foundation Java sources compile successfully with the available JDK.
- Validation blocked: Maven is not installed, Maven dependencies are not cached, and full JUnit/Maven test execution could not run.
- Validation blocked: live MySQL schema/seed execution could not be confirmed because the workspace `.envrc` fails while sourcing `.env/bin/activate`; no database changes were executed by the agent.
- Phase 1 is not marked complete until Maven tests, schema execution, seed execution, and MySQL integration connectivity are verified.
- Next task: install/enable Maven and repair or bypass the workspace direnv setup, then run foundation tests and execute schema/seed against a dedicated test database.

## Phase 1 Final Local Validation — 2026-09-30
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- JDK compilation of foundation sources excluding Maven-resolved logging classes: passed.
- Schema and seed resource presence checks: passed.
- Deferred attendance-session timetable foreign-key check: passed.
- Full Phase 1 status: INCOMPLETE pending Maven dependency resolution, JUnit execution, schema execution, seed execution, Swing launch verification, and MySQL integration connectivity.
